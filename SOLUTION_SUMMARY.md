## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** — Component-based UI
- **Vite** — Fast dev server and optimized build
- **Framer Motion** — Smooth animations and transitions
- **CSS (Component-scoped)** — Responsive, clean styling

### Backend
- **Node.js + Express** — REST API server
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** — NoSQL database with schema validation
- **Cloudinary** — Cloud image hosting (optional)
- **Multer** — File upload handling
- **CORS** — Cross-origin request support

### Deployment (Recommended)
- **Vercel** — Frontend hosting (fast, global CDN)
- **Railway** or **Heroku** — Backend hosting
- **MongoDB Atlas** — Cloud database (free tier available)
- **Cloudinary** — Image CDN (free tier available)

## Key Features

### ✅ Immediate Display of Contacts
- **8 seeded temporary contacts** are displayed on the front page instantly (no wait).
- If server is running, server contacts are merged with seed (server entries take precedence).
- If server unavailable, a notification appears and app continues with local data.

### ✅ Real-Time Search
- Search by name, email, or phone number.
- Results update in real-time (debounced to 250ms for performance).
- Clear search to see all contacts.

### ✅ Add Contact with Optional Avatar Upload
- Form validates: Name (required), Email (required, must be valid), Phone (required), Avatar (optional file).
- Avatar upload to Cloudinary (if configured) or default ui-avatars.com image if skipped.
- Duplicate detection: Server returns 409 if email or phone already exists.
- Toast notifications for success or error.

### ✅ Persistent Data
- **Server-side**: MongoDB with unique indexes on email and phone.
- **Client-side fallback**: localStorage (key: `contacts_local_v1`) for offline support.
- **Optimistic add**: New contacts appear instantly in the UI before server confirmation.

### ✅ Offline Support
- If server unreachable, app continues to work with locally stored contacts.
- New contacts added offline are stored in localStorage and persist after page refresh.
- Manual "Sync" button to retry server connection.

### ✅ Smooth Animations
- Page load and list transitions use Framer Motion spring physics.
- No fluttering or blinking — animations are carefully designed to avoid layout thrashing.
- Hover effects on contact cards (CSS-based for performance).

## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v14+ and npm v6+
- MongoDB Atlas connection string (free tier at mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- (Optional) Cloudinary account for avatar uploads

### Setup
```bash
# 1. Frontend dependencies
cd C:\Users\utkar\Videos\Assignment_tria\contact-list-app
npm install

# 2. Server dependencies
cd server
npm install
cd ..

# 3. Configure .env
# Edit server/.env and set:
# - MONGODB_URI = your MongoDB connection string
# - CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = your cloud name (optional)
```

### Run
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd server
npm run dev
# Output: "Server listening on port 4000"

# Terminal 2: Frontend
npm run dev
# Output: "Local: http://localhost:5173/"
```

### Test
- Visit http://localhost:5173/
- See 8 seeded contacts on the front page
- Search, add, and interact with the app

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/contacts?q=search` | List all or search contacts |
| POST | `/contacts` | Create new contact (returns 409 for duplicates) |
| POST | `/upload` | Upload image to Cloudinary (returns { url }) |
| GET | `/health` | Health check |

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. Seeded Front Page
**Why**: Users see 8 contacts immediately without waiting for server.
**How**: 8 temporary contacts in `mockContacts.js` seeded into localStorage on first load. Server contacts merge without removing seed.

### 2. Optimistic Add
**Why**: Instant feedback to user actions improves perceived performance.
**How**: New contacts inserted at top of list immediately; server POST in background. If duplicate, toast shows error.

### 3. Cloudinary for Avatar Upload
**Why**: Secure, CDN-hosted, no server storage overhead.
**How**: `/upload` endpoint streams file to Cloudinary; returned secure URL stored in MongoDB and used in UI.

### 4. LocalStorage Fallback
**Why**: Resilience — app works even if MongoDB is down.
**How**: When server unreachable, `contactService` uses localStorage. New contacts stored locally and persist.

### 5. Deduplication by Email/Phone
**Why**: Prevents duplicate entries in database.
**How**: MongoDB unique indexes on `email` and `phone` (case-insensitive). Server returns 409 if duplicate detected.

### 6. No Animation Fluttering
**Why**: Animations that remount list items cause visual flicker.
**How**: Removed per-item entrance/exit animations; only initial load and hover effects (CSS).

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Load app → see 8 seeded contacts
- [ ] Search → filters work correctly
- [ ] Add contact → appears immediately, server notified
- [ ] Duplicate → see error toast
- [ ] Offline → stop server, reload, app still works
- [ ] Avatar upload → image appears (if Cloudinary configured)
- [ ] Browser console → no errors
- [ ] Mobile view → responsive design works

---

## Known Limitations

- **No sync UI for local-only contacts**: Local contacts not auto-uploaded to server when reachable.
- **No edit/delete**: Contacts can only be added.
- **No authentication**: Anyone with backend URL can add contacts.
- **No tests**: No unit or E2E tests (can add Jest + Cypress).
